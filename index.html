      I'm an allied health care professional and higher education tutor
      currently transitioning into software development through

    </p>
    <p>
      I've been interested in coding since my teens but didn't have the
      opportunity until recently to see where a career in tech might take me.
      I'm excited to see how my experiences outside of tech might positively
      inform my career as a software dev.
